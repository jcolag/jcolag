# Hi, I'm John ðŸ‘‹ (he/him)

If you want to know more (maybe too much) about me, you should check out my [website](https://john.colagioia.net/) for links onward, including my [blog](https://john.colagioia.net/blog).  But the short version is that, in my spare time, I work on projects that amuse me, whether it's learning about some corner of technology, prototyping new ideas, or just writing out what might be useful later on down the line.

Here's a sample of topics I've been talking about, this past week or so on the blog.

Feel free to suggest ideas on any project or just poke at me to say "hi." Not literally poke, though. Have some self-respect.
